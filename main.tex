\begin{abstract}
This document describes the creation of mock--up lime--based paint layer.
It has been used by the author in the past to simulate readhesion interventions.
A lime slurry is filled in DIY flat molds and is set to carbonated in controlled environmental conditions.
The descriptions is optimized for paint layer flakes of \SI[product-units = single]{5 x 5 x 0.05}{\cm}.
The work is executed on a \gls{pmma} surface on which 2 groups of each 4 flakes are produced.
The preparation of the flakes and manipulation within the experiments takes some manual skill.
Four weeks should be allocated to the preparation.

\section{Material list}

\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
  \item \gls{pmma} plate \SI{0.5}{\cm},
  \item \gls{pmma} plate \SI{0.2}{\cm},
  \item sheet of \gls{hdpe} with \SI{0.05}{\cm} or preferred layer thickness,
  \item \gls{pet} film,
  \item double--sided adhesive,
  \item slake lime,
  \item \ce{CaCO3}--powder,
  \item water sprayer,
  \item climate chamber or air tight boxes and \ce{K2SO4}, \ce{NaCl}, solid \ce{CO2}

\end{inparaenum}


\section{Mold}

Any plane glass--like surface can be used as mold support.
A \gls{pmma} plate of a thickness of \SI{0.5}{\cm} has proven to be both sturdy enough and relatively easy to score and brake to the right size.
The \gls{pmma} plate is scored on lines, dividing the plate in \SI{15}{\cm} wide elements.
A clean break can be obtained by placing the scored line on a bevel and applying uniform force parallel to the line.
Those elements are then divided in \SI{27}{\cm} intervals using the same separating technique to obtain \SI[product-units = single]{15 x 27 x 0.5}{\cm} pieces.

Water is sprayed on the platform surface.
Benefiting from the high surface tension of water, a \gls{pet} film is then 'coated' on to it.
The air bubbles between the \gls{pmma} plate and \gls{pet} film are eliminated from the center to the border by means of a brush.

In the next step, a sheet of \gls{hdpe} with a material thickness of \SI{0.05}{\cm} is cut into \SI{1}{\cm} wide strips.
The strips are further divided into \SI{25}{\cm} and \SI{11}{\cm} long elements.
For each mold support, 2 long strips and 3 short strips are needed.

Double--sided adhesive tape is now applied to one side of the strips.
The first \SI{25}{\cm} long strip is adhered on the \gls{pet}--“coated” \gls{pmma} board.
Following the 3 shorter elements are attached perpendicular to it: one at each end and one in the middle.
The second \SI{25}{\cm} strip is adhered parallel to the first one at the other end of the small elements.
Thus, two empty squares of \SI[product-units = single]{11 x 11}{\cm} are created.
The result of this procedure is llustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:mold}.

\end{figure}

\section{Material preparation}

Two parts of \ce{CaCO3}--powder,
0.1 parts of yellow ochre and 1 part of slaked lime are mixed together for \SI{10}{\minute} using a trowel.
No additional water is needed.
The lime paste is applied in the squares of the molds, starting from the center and then dragging the material to the borders.
For this part a wide trowel, covering the span of the mold, works best.
Holding the trowel at a low angle and letting it slide on the mold border will level the material to a height of \SI{\approx0.05}{\cm}.


\section{Conditioning}

Once a mold is finished it should be quickly be inserted into a high humidity environment of \SI{\approx95}{\percent}.
If a climate chamber is not available for this purpose, the molds can be placed in a closed box containing a \ce{K2SO4} brine, thus creating a relative humidity of \SI{\approx97}{\percent} at \SI{20}{\celsius}.
This humid environment conditioning should ideally last 2--5 days to allow for a slower loss of water without causing cracking.
Carbonation is not favored in those conditions.
Therefore after the initial settling time the molds are taken to a lower relative humidity of \SI{\approx65}{\percent}.
This phase needs particular care in the beginning:
Whenever the surface shows signs of drying, such as the brightening of surface color, it should be moistened with a fine water haze using a well--functioning water sprayer.
The first 8 hours in \SI{\approx65}{\percent} relative humidity are the most critical for avoiding cracking.
In the following days water spraying can be reduced slowly and finally stoped.
Molds are left in these conditions for 3 weeks allowing carbonation of the specimen.
If a climate chamber is not available a \ce{NaCl} brine can be used used in a closed box to creating a relative humidity of \SI{\approx75.5}{\percent} at \SI{20}{\celsius}.
In this case some dry ice (solid \ce{CO2}) should be placed in the box to provide the required \ce{CO2} for the carbonation process (\SI{100}{\g} dry ice sublime to \SI{\approx54}{\l} gaseous \ce{CO2}).
Using a high \ce{CO2} environment will reduce the time required for carbonation of the specimen.


\section{Flake separation}

During the last step, lime--based paint layers measuring \SI[product-units = single]{11 x 11}{\cm} are divided into 4 squared flakes with dimensions of \SI[product-units = single]{5 x 5 x 0.05}{\cm}.
In order to work efficiently without breaking the fragile \ce{CaCO3}--plates, a set of stencils can be used made from the \SI{0.2}{\mm} \gls{pmma} board.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{stencil_00}
  \caption{(Left) Stencil used to cut the line in between the flakes. (Right) Stencil used to cut the outlines of the flakes.}}
  \label{fig:stencil_00}
\end{figure}

The first stencil, used to cut the line in between the flakes, is composed of four \SI[product-units = single]{6 x 6}{\cm} squares, glued to a frame forming a large squares leaving a slight space in between each other (Figure~\ref{fig:stencil_00} left).
The second element, used to cut the outlines of the flakes, is a simple \SI[product-units = single]{10 x 10}{\cm} square with a scored target cross centered at its middle (Figure~\ref{fig:stencil_00} right).
The first element is applied in the middle of the lime--based paint layer.
With a scalpel lines are scored in the space between the \gls{pmma} squares (Figure~\ref{fig:scoring_01}).
The second stencil element is now positioned on the just scored target cross of the lime--based paint layer and the outer lines are scored with the scalpel (Figure~\ref{fig:scoring_02}).

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.48\textwidth}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{scoring_01}
  \caption{Scoring of the lime--based paint layer (inner lines).}
  \label{fig:scoring_01}
  \end{minipage}
  \hfill
  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.48\textwidth}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{scoring_02}
  \caption{Scoring of the lime--based paint layer (outline).}
  \label{fig:scoring_02}
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

The separation of the different flakes is the most difficult part of the process as the thin and brittle material can be easily damaged.
To accomplish this the surrounding \ce{CaCO3}--material is first broken with the scalpel pressing the blade upright on the surface and freeing a \SI[product-units = single]{10 x 10}{\cm} main square.
The blade is then pressed carefully between the individual flakes to separate them.
